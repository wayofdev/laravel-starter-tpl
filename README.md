# Laravel Starter Template

This is an **opinionated** modified version of the Laravel framework which aims at providing a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) structure.

## üìÑ About

Laravel is a popular PHP web framework that provides an easy and efficient way to build web applications. However, the default structure of Laravel, coupled with Eloquent's active record pattern, may not always fit the needs of a project that requires a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. Eloquent's active record pattern breaks DDD principles and make it difficult to separate your business logic from your infrastructure code.

This repository provides a modified file structure for Laravel that follows DDD principles and tries to adhere to best practices, such as those outlined in Spatie's Laravel Beyond CRUD. The goal is to provide a starting point for building Laravel applications using a DDD approach, while still leveraging the power and convenience of the Laravel framework.

<br>

## üíø Installation

> Warning: You should configure, set up, and run the [docker-shared-services](https://github.com/wayofdev/docker-shared-services) repository to ensure system-wide TLS and DNS support.

1. **Clone** repository:

   After forking or creating generating repository from template, you can clone it to your local machine. In this example we will use `laravel-starter-tpl` repository as starting point.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:wayofdev/laravel-starter-tpl.git
   ```

2. **Generate** `.env` file

   Generate .env file from .env.example file using Makefile command:

   ```bash
   $ make env \
       APP_NAME=laravel \
       SHARED_SERVICES_NAMESPACE=ss \
       COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=laravel-starter-tpl
   ```

   **Change** generated `.env` file to match your needs, if needed.

   (Optional): to re-generate `.env` file, add `FORCE=true` to the end of command:

   ```bash
   $ make env \
       APP_NAME=laravel \
       SHARED_SERVICES_NAMESPACE=ss \
       COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=laravel-starter-tpl \
       FORCE=true
   ```

3. **Build**, install and run. This will also generate Laravel app key:

   ```bash
   $ make

   # or run commands separately
   $ make hooks
   $ make install
   $ make key
   $ make prepare
   $ make up
   ```
